# Introduction

## Reproducibility crisis

- Reproducibility crisis in science, ecology (Fidler, Fraser, Parker, Nakagawa).
- questionable research practices in science, ecology (Fraser)

## Identifying reproducibility issues for decision support in ecology and conservation: non-hypothesis testing based research

- Implications of irreproducible research in ecology and conservation (and hence, why examining reproducibility in this field of science is imperitive) 
- angle of the paper is on applied ecological research. so even if the research methods explored in this paper aren't modelling decisions directly, the evidence the primary research generates is used to inform decisions.

- Non-NHST research methods in ecology and conservation science common, and to date, most repro research is NHST based.

## Defining QRPs for non-NHST scientific methods

Turning to existing literature in CDM and Enviro modelling - "Good Modelling Practice", gives us some insight into how we might define QRPs for non-NHST research.

- models
- decisions

A questionable research practice is an action by a researcher that increases the chance that you end up with an informative model. For decisions, it is a modelling or other research practice that allows the decision-maker to discriminate between, and choose between a set of decision alternatives, when, without the practice, you wouldn't be able to.
The result is that the model appears more favourable than it really is, and readers or users of the model place increased and unwarrented confidence in the model's ability.

Importantly, outfright fraud or bad scientific practice does not constitute a QRP.

# Materials and Methods

## Respondant List Generation and Sampling Design

- How many respondants should we aim for?

## Survey Design

### sub-fields and methods

How did we choose these (e.g. Bayesian)?

### Survey questions - how did we choose these?

## Data Analysis

What analyses?

- Response rate (total emailed, total responses, by method).
