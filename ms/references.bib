TLDR: By linking all stages of an ecological modelling exercise, it is possible to overcome common challenges faced by ecological modellers, such as changing study areas, choosing between different modelling approaches, and evaluating the appropriateness of the model, and contributes to position predictive ecology as a central contributor to global change forecasting.},
