TLDR: The findings confirm the crucial importance of variable selection and the inability of current evaluation metrics to assess the biological significance of distribution models and recommend that researchers carefully select variables according to the species{\textquoteright} ecology and evaluate models only according to their capacity to be transfered in distant areas.}
