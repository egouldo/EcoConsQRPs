TLDR: This paper investigates how one can divert the quantification of fairness by describing a practice called {\textquotedblleft}fairness hacking{\textquotedblright} for the purpose of shrouding unfairness in algorithms, and introduces two different categories of fairness hacking in reference to the established concept of p-hacking.},

TLDR: The AUCs for some models are over-inflated, which risks exposing patients to sub-optimal clinical decision-making and greater modelling transparency is needed, including published protocols, and data and code sharing.},

TLDR: A mathematical model of scientific discovery that combines hypothesis formation, replication, publication bias, and variation in research quality is developed and it is found that communication of negative replications may aid true discovery even when attempts to replicate have diminished power.},
